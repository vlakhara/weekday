# Assignment Overview

```
As per the requirements, I have developed the page which includes 2 sections

1. Filter
    -> Filter includes some select fields and text field
    -> Jobs will get filters based on the selected filters
2. Jobs
    -> Show JOBS we get from the API
    -> Added Infinite Scroll
    -> Added some extra information to each job which were required for some of the filters to work
```

## NOTE

```
Some of the filters can look no consistent, which is not right. I am generating random values which were not preset in the job data and which we needed in the filters
```

# Thank You
